            "How does Linux perf_events support JIT symbol inspection and what is required to enable it?": "Linux perf_events added JIT symbol support in 2009, allowing for the inspection of symbols from language virtual machines like the JVM. To enable JIT symbol inspection, the JIT application (such as v8 in the case of Node.js) needs to be modified to create a /tmp/perf-PID.map file. This file is a simple text database that contains symbol addresses, sizes, and names. When perf_events is used, it looks for this map file and uses it for symbol translations. In the case of Node.js, v8 was modified to create the necessary map file, enabling the inspection of JavaScript symbols in flame graphs generated using Linux perf_events."

Start the Node.js application with the --perf-basic-prof option: `~/node-v0.11.13-linux-x64/bin/node --perf-basic-prof hello.js &`\n\n2. Record the CPU usage using perf: `sudo perf record -F 99 -p `pgrep -n node` -g -- sleep 30`\n\n3. Generate the perf script: `perf script > out.nodestacks01`\n\n4. Clone the FlameGraph repository: `git clone --depth 1 http://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph`\n\n5. Navigate to the FlameGraph directory: `cd FlameGraph`\n\n6. Use the stackcollapse-perf.pl script to collapse the perf script output: `./stackcollapse-perf.pl < ../out.nodestacks01`\n\n7. Use the flamegraph.pl script to generate the flame graph: `./flamegraph.pl > ../out.nodestacks01.svg`\n\nThese steps will generate a flame graph in SVG format, which can be opened in a web browser to visualize the CPU usage of the Node.js application. The flame graph will include JavaScript symbols, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization of the application's performance."

        {
            "What is the limitation of using --perf-basic-prof for long periods and how can it be addressed?": "The use of --perf-basic-prof for long periods can lead to a limitation related to the growth of the perf.map file. The perf.map file can grow endlessly, consuming gigabytes of storage in just a few days. This growth is caused by symbols moving location, which is not expected behavior with --perf-basic-prof. To address this limitation, a new option called --perf_basic_prof_only_functions (or --perf-basic-prof-only-functions) was introduced in 2016. This option only logs interesting types of symbols, reducing the growth of the map file. If map file growth is a concern, using the --perf_basic_prof_only_functions option instead of --perf-basic-prof can help mitigate the issue and allow for the use of --perf-basic-prof for longer periods without excessive storage consumption."

It is also important to consider the potential impact on the target process's performance when using dynamic tracing. Tracing too much can slow down the process, so more efficient tracers like Linux perf_events can be considered. Finally, it is advisable to use uprobes in a test environment first before applying it to production systems."

        {
            "What do Linux load averages track and why do they include tasks in the uninterruptible sleep state?": "Linux load averages track both runnable tasks and tasks in the uninterruptible sleep state. The inclusion of tasks in the uninterruptible sleep state is to reflect demand for system resources beyond just CPU demand. This state is used by code paths that want to avoid interruptions by signals, such as tasks blocked on disk I/O and some locks. By including tasks in the uninterruptible sleep state, Linux load averages can accurately measure demand on the system, including disk I/O workload, and not just CPU demand."
        },
        {
            "What are the three averages shown in Linux load averages and what do they represent?": "Linux load averages show three averages for 1, 5, and 15 minutes. These averages represent the running thread (task) demand on the system as an average number of running plus waiting threads. The 1 minute average reflects recent demand, the 5 minute average provides a medium-term view, and the 15 minute average gives a longer-term perspective. These three averages allow users to determine if the load is increasing or decreasing over time, which is useful for performance analysis and capacity planning."
        },
        {
            "How can load averages be used to identify performance problems and determine if a system is idle or overloaded?": "Load averages can be used to identify performance problems and determine the system's state. If the load averages are 0.0, it indicates that the system is idle. If the 1 minute average is higher than the 5 or 15 minute averages, it suggests that the load is increasing. Conversely, if the 1 minute average is lower than the 5 or 15 minute averages, it indicates that the load is decreasing. Additionally, if the load averages are higher than the CPU count, it may indicate a performance problem, although this depends on the specific workload. Load averages provide a concise way to assess system demand and can be used in conjunction with other metrics for a more comprehensive performance analysis."

        {
            "What are some alternative metrics that can be used in conjunction with load averages for performance analysis?": "While load averages provide valuable insights into system demand, they can be complemented with other metrics for a more detailed performance analysis. Some alternative metrics include per-CPU utilization, per-process CPU utilization, per-thread run queue latency, CPU run queue length, and disk I/O metrics. These metrics can provide additional visibility into CPU and disk utilization, as well as the latency experienced by threads in the run queue. By combining load averages with these metrics, users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of system performance and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization."

They are useful for performance analysis because they provide a clear and intuitive way to identify hotspots and bottlenecks in an application. By analyzing the width and color of the flame graph, developers can quickly identify which functions or methods are consuming the most CPU time and focus their optimization efforts accordingly. Flame graphs can be generated using profiling tools like Linux perf or JVM profilers, and they can be used to analyze performance in a wide range of scenarios, from microservices to large-scale distributed systems."

In the flame graphs shown in the article, yellow represents C++ code executed by the JVM, green represents Java methods, orange represents kernel code, and red represents other user-level code. This color coding helps in understanding the distribution of CPU time across different types of code and can provide insights into performance bottlenecks. For example, if a significant portion of CPU time is spent in kernel code (orange), it could indicate issues with system calls or I/O operations. Similarly, if a large portion of CPU time is spent in Java methods (green), it could indicate performance issues within the application itself."

JVM profilers cannot see kernel code execution with Java context, while the Linux perf profiler can. This means that the Linux perf profiler provides a more comprehensive view of the system, including the ability to analyze the performance impact of kernel code on Java applications. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where kernel code execution is a significant factor in overall performance. By using the Linux perf profiler, developers can gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics of their Java applications and make more informed optimization decisions."

            "What are some potential reasons for the truncated stacks observed in the flame graphs shown in the article?": "The article mentions that the flame graphs show truncated stacks, which means that not all frames of the stack trace are captured. This can happen due to the default settings of Linux perf, which only captures the top 127 frames. Truncated stacks can break flame graphs because the graphing software doesn't know where to merge them. However, the article also mentions that this will be tunable in Linux 4.8 with the `kernel.perf_event_max_stack` setting. It's important to note that truncated stacks can limit the accuracy and completeness of the flame graphs, potentially obscuring important performance insights. Developers should be aware of this limitation and consider adjusting the settings to capture a more complete stack trace when necessary."

The selfless brilliant jerk, represented by the fictional character Alice, is a brilliant engineer who cares about the company but lacks empathy for others. She is direct and honest, often coming across as mean-spirited when expressing her unpopular opinions. Alice believes that being mean shouldn't hurt the company and sees little business value in empathy. On the other hand, the selfish brilliant jerk, represented by the fictional character Bob, is a brilliant engineer who is selfish, lacks empathy, and has delusions of grandeur. He believes that any behavior that benefits himself is justified, even if it means abusing and exploiting others. Bob is charming and charismatic, using his personality to manipulate and deceive others. While both types of brilliant jerks exhibit negative behavior, the selfless jerk may still have some positive impact on the company, while the selfish jerk causes significant damage."

He interrupts others and ignores their opinions, believing that he is the most important person in the room. Bob only works on projects that benefit himself, leaving others to finish his abandoned work. He bullies, humiliates, and oppresses individuals, using sarcasm and insults to shame and mock them. Bob engages in displays of dominance in front of groups, showing off his importance and superiority. He tries to assert authority over all areas of the company, denigrating those he cannot control. Bob is negative, trash-talking others and attacking technologies that don't align with his own beliefs. He manipulates and misleads, using deception and lies to further his own agenda. Bob also uses physical intimidation, invading personal space and making violent gestures. The impact of Bob's behavior on the company is significant. He silences technical opinions, lowers the company's technical IQ, and creates extra work for others. Bob demoralizes staff, causing stress-related illness and increasing absenteeism. He drives talented employees to quit, strengthening the competition and making it difficult to hire new staff. Bob creates a hostile workplace environment and inspires others to imitate his behavior, multiplying the problem. Overall, Bob's behavior has a detrimental effect on productivity, morale, and the company's reputation."
        },
        {
            "How can companies effectively deal with brilliant jerks like Bob and Alice?": "Dealing with brilliant jerks like Bob and Alice requires a multi-faceted approach. One important step is for companies to adopt a `no brilliant jerks` policy, explicitly stating that such behavior will not be tolerated. This policy should come from the top, with support from the CEO and management. By setting clear expectations and consequences, companies can create a culture that values teamwork and respectful behavior. It is also crucial for management to be aware of the damage caused by brilliant jerks and to take action when necessary. This may involve providing feedback to the jerk, making it clear that their behavior is hurting the company and giving them an opportunity to change. However, in the case of a selfish jerk like Bob, it is unlikely that they will genuinely care or change. In such cases, management should be prepared to take more decisive action, including potentially terminating the jerk's employment. It is important for colleagues, victims, and witnesses of the jerk's behavior to report incidents to management, providing information without explicitly asking for the jerk to be fired. Regular one-on-one meetings and skip-level meetings can also help inform management about the impact of the jerk's behavior. Additionally, companies can promote a culture of empathy and kindness, encouraging employees to exercise emotional intelligence and treat others with respect. By creating an environment where brilliant jerks are not tolerated, companies can foster a positive and productive workplace."

            "What is the purpose of the `__fentry__` code at the start of every kernel function in Linux?": "The `__fentry__` code is a mechanism used in the Linux kernel for function tracing and profiling. It serves as an entry point for function tracing and allows for the collection of data about the execution of each kernel function. When a function is called, the `__fentry__` code is executed first, and it records information such as the function's address and the current timestamp. This data can then be used for performance analysis and debugging purposes. By having this code at the start of every kernel function, it ensures that all functions are instrumented and can be traced."

            "How does Ftrace instrument all kernel functions almost instantly and with low overhead?": "Ftrace is a built-in tracing framework in the Linux kernel that provides low-overhead instrumentation of kernel functions. It achieves this by leveraging the dynamic function tracing (DFT) feature of the kernel. DFT allows for the insertion of tracepoints at the entry and exit points of kernel functions, which can be used to collect data about their execution. Ftrace utilizes these tracepoints to instrument all kernel functions almost instantly. When Ftrace is enabled, it scans the kernel's symbol table to identify all the functions and inserts tracepoints at their entry and exit points. This process is performed dynamically and does not require any modifications to the kernel's source code. As a result, Ftrace can instrument all kernel functions with minimal overhead, allowing for efficient performance analysis and profiling."

RCU is a synchronization mechanism used in the Linux kernel to allow for efficient read-side access to shared data structures. However, in certain scenarios, RCU can introduce overhead and impact performance. In this case, Ftrace was used to trace the execution of RCU-related functions and analyze their behavior. By enabling Ftrace and configuring it to trace the relevant functions, the performance engineer was able to collect data about the execution of these functions and identify potential bottlenecks. The collected data included information such as the number of times each function was called, the execution time of each function, and any associated delays. This allowed the engineer to pinpoint the specific functions causing the performance issue and make optimizations to improve overall system performance."
        },

            "What are some practical usage scenarios of Ftrace and how can it be used effectively for performance analysis?": "Ftrace can be used in various practical scenarios for performance analysis in the Linux kernel. One common usage scenario is the identification of performance bottlenecks by tracing the execution of specific functions or subsystems. By enabling Ftrace and configuring it to trace the relevant functions or subsystems, performance engineers can collect data about their execution and analyze their behavior. This can help identify functions that are taking a significant amount of time to execute or subsystems that are causing performance degradation. Another usage scenario is the analysis of interrupt handling and scheduling behavior. Ftrace can be used to trace the execution of interrupt handlers and analyze their impact on system performance. It can also be used to trace the scheduling behavior of the kernel and identify any scheduling-related issues. Additionally, Ftrace can be used for debugging purposes by tracing the execution of specific functions or subsystems to understand their behavior and identify any potential bugs or issues. Overall, Ftrace provides a powerful tool for performance analysis in the Linux kernel and can be used effectively in various real-world scenarios."

Then, CPU flame graphs were collected for both CentOS and Ubuntu instances to compare the CPU time distribution. The flame graphs revealed the excessive CPU time in the os::javaTimeMillis() function. The flame graph analysis also involved studying the flame graph to understand the function call hierarchy and identify potential causes. Additionally, colleagues and internet searches were consulted for insights and recommendations. Finally, experimentation was conducted by microbenchmarking the os::javaTimeMillis() function and changing the clocksource to measure the impact on performance."

The tsc clocksource was found to be significantly faster in retrieving time using just an RDTSC instruction, without the need for a syscall. This change resulted in a 43% drop in write latencies and improved performance compared to the CentOS setup. The CPU flame graph after the workaround showed that os::javaTimeMillis() accounted for only 1.6% of the total CPU time. The workaround was successful and became a recommended practice, even being included in AWS recommendations for EC2 instances on the Xen Hypervisor."

Firstly, maintaining and updating the toolkit for multiple operating systems and kernel versions became impractical, as the scripts were more tied to specific kernel versions than expected. Secondly, the creator of the DTraceToolkit accepted a job to work primarily on Linux performance, which shifted his focus away from Solaris and its derivatives. As a result, the DTraceToolkit was no longer a priority and there were new and exciting things in tech to work on. Instead of continuing the DTraceToolkit project, two alternatives were suggested. The first alternative was to split the toolkit into two collections, as mentioned earlier, to address the different requirements of users and performance engineers. The second alternative was to focus on new tools and technologies such as Linux eBPF, which were more related to the creator's day job and career going forward."

It provided advanced performance insight beyond the typical Unix toolset and was appreciated by its users. However, due to the challenges of maintaining and updating the toolkit for multiple operating systems and kernel versions, it was no longer recommended to continue the project. As alternatives, other projects were created to address performance analysis needs. One such project was the DTrace-tools collection for FreeBSD, which was released by the creator of the DTraceToolkit. Additionally, the creator started working on new tools based on Linux ftrace, perf_events, SystemTap, and eBPF to bring observability to Linux and share these scripts online. These new tools aimed to provide similar functionality to the DTraceToolkit but were tailored for Linux performance analysis."

They can be used in performance analysis to collect and analyze various types of data, such as histograms, summary statistics, frequency counts, and latency measurements. eBPF maps are populated by custom eBPF programs running in the kernel, and the data can be read asynchronously from user-level code. For example, in the article, the bitehist tool uses an eBPF map to store a histogram of disk I/O sizes. This allows for the analysis of the distribution of I/O sizes, which can be useful in identifying performance patterns or anomalies."

First, eBPF is integrated into the Linux kernel, which means it can provide low-overhead tracing capabilities without the need for external modules or modifications to the kernel. This makes it easier to use and deploy. Second, eBPF allows for the creation of custom in-kernel maps, which can store and retrieve data efficiently. This enables the collection of detailed performance metrics, such as histograms and latency measurements, without significant overhead. Finally, eBPF is flexible and extensible, allowing for the development of custom tracing programs and tools. This makes it possible to tailor the analysis to specific use cases and requirements, providing deeper insights into system behavior and performance."

            "Can you provide an example of how eBPF and maps can be used to analyze disk I/O performance?": "Certainly! In the article, the bitehist tool is used to analyze disk I/O performance using eBPF and maps. The tool traces block device I/O and generates a histogram of the I/O sizes. The histogram shows the distribution of I/O sizes in different ranges, such as 0-1 KB, 2-3 KB, 4-7 KB, and so on. This information can be valuable in understanding the typical I/O patterns and identifying any outliers or unusual behavior. For example, in the article, it is observed that most disk I/O was between 4 and 7 KB in size, with a smaller amount between 32 and 63 KB. This suggests that the system is primarily performing I/O operations in these size ranges. By analyzing the histogram, it may be possible to optimize the system's I/O behavior, such as by adjusting buffer sizes or optimizing data transfer algorithms, to improve overall performance."

One possibility is the development of higher-level languages or front-ends for eBPF, which could make it easier for users to write and deploy eBPF programs. This would lower the barrier to entry and enable more widespread adoption of eBPF for performance analysis. Additionally, eBPF is likely to be integrated into more tracing tools and frameworks, expanding its capabilities and making it more accessible to a wider range of users. There may also be new use cases and applications for eBPF in observability and functionality, as developers continue to explore its potential.

The tool provides information about the time spent in each state, allowing for a detailed analysis of thread behavior and performance.\n\nThe different thread states that tstates.d tracks include CPU, RUNQ, SLP, USL, SUS, SWP, LCK, IWT, and YLD. Each state represents a different aspect of thread activity and can provide insights into performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n\nFor example, the CPU state represents the time spent on the CPU, while the SLP state represents interruptible sleep. The USL state represents uninterruptible sleep, which is often associated with disk I/O operations. The SWP state represents swapped threads, and the LCK state represents threads waiting for a lock.\n\nBy analyzing the output of tstates.d, administrators and developers can identify threads that spend excessive time in certain states, such as high CPU usage or long periods of sleep. This can help pinpoint performance issues and guide optimization efforts.\n\nTo use the tstates.d tool, you would typically run it with the appropriate command-line options, such as './tstates.d'. The tool will then trace scheduler events and display the time spent in each state for different threads. By analyzing this output, you can gain insights into thread behavior and performance on FreeBSD."

The color of each box in the heat map scales to show the number of events that occurred at that second and subsecond, with darker colors indicating a higher number of events. This combination of visualizations allows for the identification of patterns and code paths responsible for performance issues."

The article provides several examples of different thread patterns and their corresponding subsecond offset heat maps. For instance, one pattern involves a single thread waking up at the same offset each second, performing a few milliseconds of work, and then going back to sleep. By visualizing this pattern in Flamescope, it becomes easier to identify the periodic activity of the thread and understand its impact on overall performance. Another example involves a busy-wait thread that does a certain amount of work and then sleeps for a whole second. This pattern results in the wakeup offset creeping forward each second. By analyzing the corresponding subsecond offset heat map in Flamescope, it becomes possible to identify the impact of this pattern on CPU utilization and potentially optimize the thread's behavior. These examples demonstrate how Flamescope can be used to analyze different thread patterns and their effects on performance."

The article provides examples of CPU utilization at different levels, ranging from 100% utilization to 5% utilization. By examining the corresponding subsecond offset heat maps in Flamescope, it becomes possible to identify the distribution of CPU utilization over time. For example, a workload with 100% CPU utilization would appear as a consistently dark heat map, indicating that all CPUs are fully utilized. On the other hand, a workload with 50% CPU utilization would show a lighter heat map, indicating that CPUs are only partially utilized. By comparing these different scenarios, it becomes possible to understand the impact of workload intensity on CPU utilization and identify potential performance bottlenecks. Flamescope's visualization capabilities make it easier to analyze and interpret variance in CPU utilization."

The article provides examples of CPU perturbations, CPU blocking, and single-threaded blocking. CPU perturbations occur when all CPUs max out for a certain duration, such as during garbage collection (GC). By visualizing the corresponding subsecond offset heat map in Flamescope, it becomes possible to identify these perturbations and their impact on overall CPU activity. Similarly, CPU blocking occurs when all CPUs idle for a certain duration, such as during I/O operations. Flamescope can visualize these blocking periods and help identify potential performance issues related to I/O. Single-threaded blocking is another interesting pattern where all CPUs idle except one, indicating that all threads are blocked on a lock held by that one thread. Flamescope allows users to click on the corresponding pink line in the visualization to view the flame graph of the blocking thread, making it easier to analyze and troubleshoot performance problems related to locks."

This includes events like `sched:sched_stat_sleep`, `sched:sched_switch`, and `sched:sched_process_exit`.\n2. Use the `perf inject` command to convert the raw trace data into a format that can be processed further.\n3. Use the `perf script` command with the `-f` or `-F` option to extract relevant information from the trace data. This information includes the command, process ID, thread ID, CPU, time, period, event, instruction pointer, symbol, and dynamic shared object.\n4. Use additional tools like `awk`, `stackcollapse.pl`, and `flamegraph.pl` to process and visualize the extracted information as an Off-CPU Time Flame Graph.\nThese steps allow for the generation of Off-CPU Time Flame Graphs using Linux perf_events, providing insights into blocked time and latency-related performance issues."

The overhead of dumping scheduler events to the file system (`perf.data`) can be significant in production environments. This can impact system performance and should be tested carefully.\n2. To reduce overhead, consider using tools that can summarize data in-kernel, such as perf_events with extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) support. This allows for more efficient processing and analysis of trace data.\n3. The availability of tracepoints and features in the kernel can vary across different versions and distributions. Ensure that your kernel has the necessary configurations (e.g., `CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS`) to support the required tracepoints for Off-CPU Analysis.\n4. For older kernels that lack certain features, additional processing of the `perf script` output may be required using tools like `awk` to stitch together events.\n5. If the overhead is acceptable and you are interested in analyzing a specific process ID (PID), consider using the `-p PID` option in `perf record` instead of capturing events for the entire system (`-a`).\nBy considering these factors and exploring alternative tools, you can perform Off-CPU Analysis effectively in production environments."

They are described in the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual. MSRs are read and written using the RDMSR and WRMSR instructions. In performance analysis, MSRs can be used to measure the real clock rate and the degree of turbo boost, which is important for understanding performance variations and comparing systems or software. MSRs can also be used to measure other performance events, such as data cache misses and stall cycles, using performance monitoring counters (PMCs). However, on AWS EC2, PMCs are not available within a cloud instance, so MSRs are used as an alternative for performance analysis."

These MSRs can be used to measure temperature, clock rates, and turbo boost ratios, providing valuable insights into CPU performance."
        },
        {
            "How can MSRs be measured and what tools can be used for reading MSRs on Intel processors?": "To measure MSRs on Intel processors, you can use the rdmsr tool, which is part of the msr-tools package. The rdmsr tool allows you to read specific MSRs by providing their addresses. For example, to read the turbo boost ratio when 10 cores are active on an Ivy Bridge processor, you can use the command `rdmsr 0x1ae -f 15:8 -d 29`, and then multiply the result by 100 to get the turbo boost ratio in MHz. The msr-tools package also provides the wrmsr tool for writing to MSRs. Additionally, there are other tools available, such as i7z, which can be used to debug turbo boost and read MSRs. These tools provide a way to directly measure real clock rates, turbo boost, and other CPU performance metrics."

        {
            "Why is measuring turbo boost important in performance analysis and how can it affect performance comparisons?": "Measuring turbo boost is important in performance analysis because it can significantly impact CPU performance and skew performance comparisons. Turbo boost is the Intel processor technology that dynamically overclocks CPUs, allowing them to run at higher clock speeds depending on factors such as temperature, power consumption, and core utilization. Colder servers tend to run faster due to turbo boost. However, this variability in clock speeds can introduce uncertainty and make it challenging to accurately compare performance between systems or software. For example, if one system has a higher turbo boost frequency than another, it may appear faster in certain workloads, even if the base clock speeds are the same. By measuring turbo boost and understanding its impact, performance analysts can account for these variations and make more informed performance comparisons."

A higher CPI value indicates that it takes more cycles to complete instructions, often due to stalled cycles while waiting for memory I/O. By understanding the CPI ratio, performance tuning efforts can be directed towards optimizing the areas where the CPUs are spending more cycles, leading to improved overall performance. For example, if a specific function or workload has a high CPI ratio, it may indicate that there are opportunities to optimize memory I/O or reduce stalls, resulting in faster execution and improved performance."

            "How does the new visualization technique of assigning colors relative to CPI in a CPU flame graph help in understanding CPU efficiency by function?": "The new visualization technique of assigning colors relative to CPI in a CPU flame graph provides a clear visualization of CPU efficiency by function. The width of each frame in the flame graph represents the time a function (or its children) was on-CPU, as with a normal CPU flame graph. However, the color now shows what that function was doing when it was on-CPU: running or stalled. The color range is scaled to color the highest CPI blue (indicating slower instructions) and the lowest CPI red (indicating faster instructions). By visualizing CPU efficiency by function, it becomes easier to identify which functions are causing stalls or inefficiencies, allowing for targeted performance optimizations. For example, in the provided example of a FreeBSD kernel, the vm_* (virtual memory) functions have the slowest instructions due to memory I/O, while the __mtx_lock_sleep function has the fastest instructions due to being a spin loop. This visualization can prompt further study and development to improve the efficiency of specific functions."

            "What are the two parts that make differential flame graphs possible, and how do they contribute to performance analysis?": "The two parts that make differential flame graphs possible are differential flame graphs themselves and measuring stacks on instructions and stall cycles. Differential flame graphs are generated by providing input with two value columns: before and after counts. The flame graph is sized using the second column (the 'after' or 'now') and colored using the delta of the two columns. In the case of CPI flame graphs, the two value columns are stall cycle count and unhalted cycle count. By comparing the before and after counts, differential flame graphs highlight the changes in performance metrics, making it easier to identify areas of improvement or regression. Measuring stacks on instructions and stall cycles involves using tools like pmcstat(8) on FreeBSD to collect data on CPU performance counters and call chains. This data is then used to generate the necessary input for differential flame graphs. By measuring stacks on instructions and stall cycles, it becomes possible to analyze the performance of specific functions or workloads and understand their impact on CPU efficiency, leading to targeted optimizations."

The first command collects performance counter data for 10 seconds, measuring resource stalls and unhalted cycles. The second command processes the collected data and generates a callchain text file. The callchain text file contains information about the CPU samples and their associated call chains. The collected data is then converted to the folded format using the stackcollapse-pmc.pl script. Finally, the CPI flame graph is generated using the difffolded.pl and flamegraph.pl scripts. These tools and techniques allow for the visualization and analysis of CPU efficiency by function, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization."

They show the stack traces of threads that are blocked on the CPU (off-CPU stack) and the stack traces of the threads that wake them up (wakeup stack). By analyzing these flame graphs, we can understand the reasons behind thread blocking and identify the specific functions or operations that are causing the blockage. For example, in the article, the off-wake flame graph shows that the `sshd` process is blocked on the `sys_select()` function, which is woken up by the `kworker` threads doing `tty_receive_buf` handling. This information helps us understand why the `sshd` process is blocked and provides clues about the source of the blockage."

It provides a more comprehensive view of thread blocking by showing the complete sequence of wakeup events that occurred before a thread was unblocked. In the article, the author introduces a prototype of a chain graph using eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology. The chain graph includes two levels of waker stacks and displays all threads waiting for work on a file descriptor via `sys_poll()` or `sys_select()`. By clicking on a specific thread in the chain graph, we can trace back the entire chain of wakeups and understand the sequence of events that led to the thread being unblocked. This information is valuable for performance analysis as it helps identify the root causes of thread blocking and provides insights into possible tuning targets."
        },
        {
            "What are the limitations of the current chain graph prototype and what improvements are needed?": "The current chain graph prototype has several limitations and areas that need improvement. First, the prototype limits the waker stacks to 7 frames each due to a stack trace hack that hits the MAX_BPF_STACK limit. This limitation restricts the depth of the chain graph and may not capture all the relevant wakeup events. Second, the prototype only shows the last chain of wakeups and does not handle more complex chains. It would be beneficial to extend the chain graph to show all wakeup stacks, not just the first two. Third, the prototype displays all threads, which leads to some duplication in the graph. It may be possible to exclude certain threads to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. Fourth, the prototype needs to clean up per-thread timestamps and stacks to avoid exhausting a BPF_HASH table. Finally, the greatest challenge is keeping the overhead of the tool low enough to be acceptable. The prototype leverages eBPF for low overhead tracing, but more work, testing, and quantification are needed in this area. Overall, the chain graph prototype shows promise but requires further development and refinement to become a practical tool for performance analysis."

            "How can chain graphs be used in production to solve system issues and complement CPU flame graphs?": "Chain graphs have the potential to be used in production environments to solve system issues and complement CPU flame graphs. By visualizing the entire chain of wakeup events, chain graphs can provide a comprehensive understanding of why application threads blocked for a long time. This information is crucial for identifying and resolving performance issues. For example, in the article, the author demonstrates how clicking on a thread in the chain graph reveals that `vmstat` woke up `kworker/u16:0`  which in turn woke up `sshd` for a total of 9.0 seconds. This insight helps pinpoint the source of the blockage and provides a starting point for optimization. While chain graphs may not solve all performance issues (such as latency outliers), they serve as a valuable tool for understanding thread blocking and can be used in conjunction with CPU flame graphs to gain a holistic view of system performance. By prototyping chain graphs on Linux while eBPF and bcc are still in development, the author aims to provide a use case and work towards the practical implementation of chain graphs for performance analysis."

            "How does bpftrace improve upon the limitations of traditional Linux performance tools, and can you provide a practical example of its usage?": "Traditional Linux performance tools often rely on counter-based metrics, which can provide average values but lack the ability to reveal the distribution of these values. This limitation can obscure the identification of outliers or multiple modes, which could be the real cause of performance issues. bpftrace, an open-source tracer for Linux, improves upon this by allowing for the decomposition of metrics into distributions or per-event logs, and the creation of new metrics for visibility into blind spots. \nA practical example of bpftrace usage is the tracing of read latency for a specific process ID (PID). The command `bpftrace -e 'kprobe:vfs_read /pid == 30153/ { @start[tid] = nsecs; } kretprobe:vfs_read /@start[tid]/ { @ns = hist(nsecs - @start[tid]); delete(@start[tid]); }'` is used to trace the distribution of read latency for PID 30153, showing it as a power-of-two histogram.

For instance, kprobe and kretprobe can be used to instrument the entry and return of kernel functions, respectively. This allows for detailed tracking of function execution times, which can be crucial in identifying performance bottlenecks. An example of this is the command `bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:sys_read /pid == 181/ { @bytes = hist(retval); }'`, which instruments the return of the `sys_read()` kernel function and produces a histogram of the returned read size for PID 181.

XDP is useful in scenarios where low-latency packet processing is critical, such as network monitoring, load balancing, and DDoS mitigation. These technologies provide practical examples of how performance analysis and usage scenarios can benefit from advancements in networking. By leveraging QUIC and XDP, developers and system administrators can optimize network performance, improve user experience, and enhance the security and reliability of networked applications."

            "What are some potential pitfalls when porting BPF tracing tools to different software versions or languages?": "Porting BPF tracing tools to different software versions or languages can introduce several challenges and pitfalls. One major issue is the need for constant updates to keep the tools working across different versions. For example, a tool that works on Linux 5.3 may break on Linux 5.4 due to changes in function names or code paths. Additionally, certain BPF tools, especially those based on kprobes and uprobes, require ongoing maintenance to ensure compatibility with newer kernels. Another consideration is the evolving nature of BPF libraries and frameworks, such as the introduction of BTF and CO-RE support. If you choose to rewrite a tool, you must also plan for future updates and maintenance. It's often easier to pull updates from existing libraries and frameworks rather than maintaining your own versions. Finally, it's important to consider the trade-off between porting old tools and creating new ones. Sometimes, it may be more beneficial to build upon existing tools rather than spending time and effort on porting outdated ones."

If not, consider building one based on existing BCC or bpftrace tools rather than starting from scratch. This approach allows you to leverage the functionality and capabilities of these tools without the need for extensive development. Install the BCC or bpftrace tools, add them to your observability product, and pull package updates as needed. This provides a quick and useful version 1 of your BPF observability solution. It's important to think like a sysadmin who installs and maintains software, rather than a programmer who codes everything. By building upon existing tools, you can save time and effort while still benefiting from the power of BPF observability."

This can help them understand the reasons behind the growth in the `RES` column seen in tools like top(1). \n2. Analyzing blocking behavior: Flame graphs can show the code paths that lead to Java leaving the CPU, which can help identify the reasons behind Java blocking. This includes identifying locks, I/O operations, sleeps, and other events that cause Java to block. By analyzing these code paths, developers can optimize their application's performance by reducing unnecessary blocking behavior. \n3. Analyzing disk I/O performance: Flame graphs can also reveal the Java and system code paths that lead to issuing a disk I/O request. This can help developers understand the impact of disk I/O operations on their application's performance and optimize these code paths if necessary. \n4. Analyzing TCP events: Flame graphs can show the Java code paths that lead to initializing TCP sessions with connect() or accept(), or sending packets.

By automating the generation of flame graphs, developers can easily incorporate them into their performance analysis workflow and obtain insights more quickly. \n2. Combine with basic CPU monitoring: Before using a context switch flame graph, it is important to identify any kernel involuntary context switches due to CPU demand through basic CPU monitoring. This ensures that the flame graph accurately represents the code paths that lead to Java leaving the CPU and helps avoid misinterpretation of the results. \n3. Zoom in on specific code paths: Flame graphs provide a detailed visualization of code paths, allowing developers to zoom in on specific functions or sections of code. By focusing on specific code paths, developers can analyze them in more detail and identify potential performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization. \n4. Compare different flame graphs: Developers can generate multiple flame graphs for different scenarios or versions of their application and compare them to identify performance differences. This can help pinpoint the impact of specific changes or configurations on the application's performance and guide optimization efforts. \n5. Combine with other profiling techniques: Java mixed-mode flame graphs can be used in conjunction with other profiling techniques, such as memory profiling or CPU profiling, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the application's performance. By combining different profiling techniques, developers can gather more insights and make more informed decisions for performance optimization.

The Referenced Page Flag method utilizes a kernel feature added in Linux 2.6.22 that allows setting and reading the referenced page flag from user space. The tool wss.pl, developed by the author, resets the referenced flag on memory pages and later checks how many pages have this flag set, providing an estimation of the WSS. The Idle Page Flag method, introduced in Linux 4.3, involves marking all the workload's pages as idle and then waiting for the workload to access its working set. The number of idle pages can then be counted to estimate the WSS. Both methods provide insights into the memory usage patterns of an application and help in performance analysis and optimization."

These tools modify the state of the system by changing referenced or idle page flags, which can cause slightly higher application latency and potentially confuse the kernel's page reclamation logic. Additionally, for large processes with over 100 Gbytes of memory, the duration of higher latency can be significant, lasting over 1 second. There is also a risk of undiscovered kernel panics due to the activation of old kernel code. It is recommended to test these tools in a lab environment and consider them experimental. Users should be aware of the potential overheads and risks involved when using these tools for WSS estimation."

The flame graph is colorized to show the frames that have increased or decreased in CPU usage between the two profiles. The frames that have increased in CPU usage are shown in red, while the frames that have decreased in CPU usage are shown in blue. By analyzing the differential flame graph, developers can quickly identify the specific functions or code paths that have changed in CPU usage and are causing the regression. This can be useful for tracking down subtle regressions and understanding the impact of code changes on CPU performance. For example, if a workload sees a CPU increase after a system update, developers can use a red/blue differential flame graph to pinpoint the specific functions or code paths that are responsible for the increase in CPU usage."

Collect the first stack profile using perf record: The command `perf record -F 99 -a -g -- sleep 30` can be used to collect the first stack profile. This command records the CPU usage of all processes for 30 seconds and generates a stack profile.\n2. Collect the second stack profile using perf record: After a code change or some other event, the second stack profile can be collected using the same command as before.\n3. Fold the stack profiles: The stack profiles generated by perf record need to be folded using the `stackcollapse-perf.pl` script from the FlameGraph repository. This script converts the raw stack profiles into a folded format that can be used to generate flame graphs.\n4. Generate the red/blue differential flame graph: The `difffolded.pl` script from the FlameGraph repository can be used to generate the red/blue differential flame graph. This script takes the folded stack profiles from the previous step and produces a three-column output, with the folded stack trace and two value columns for each profile. The output can then be piped into the `flamegraph.pl` script to generate the SVG file for the differential flame graph.\nBy following these steps, developers can generate red/blue differential flame graphs using Linux perf_events and analyze the differences in CPU usage between two profiles."

Look for frames that have changed in color (red or blue) to identify the functions or code paths that have changed in CPU usage.\n2. Focus on red frames: Pay special attention to the frames that have turned red in the differential flame graph, as they indicate an increase in CPU usage. These frames are likely to be the root cause of the performance regression and should be investigated further.\n3. Consider the context: Take into account the context of the code changes or system updates that led to the performance regression. Understanding the changes that were made can provide insights into why certain functions or code paths are now consuming more CPU time.\n4. Analyze the ancestry: The width and shape of the frames in the flame graph represent the stack depth and population of each frame. Analyzing the ancestry of the frames can help in understanding the call hierarchy and identifying the critical paths that contribute to the CPU usage.\n5. Use other profiling tools: Red/blue differential flame graphs can be used in conjunction with other profiling tools to gather more information about the performance regression. For example, using a profiler like perf_events alongside the flame graphs can provide additional metrics and context for analysis.\nBy employing these strategies, developers can effectively use red/blue differential flame graphs for performance analysis and debugging, and quickly identify and resolve CPU performance regressions."

Additionally, there may be overhead associated with tracing, especially if there are a high number of events per second. While hist triggers are designed to be lightweight, it is important to be mindful of the potential impact on system performance. Finally, the default number of key slots in the histogram is 2048, and if this limit is exceeded, events will be dropped. This can be mitigated by adjusting the size parameter in the histogram configuration. Overall, hist triggers provide powerful capabilities for performance analysis, but it is important to be aware of these considerations and limitations to ensure effective and efficient usage."

            "What is the significance of observability in performance tuning, and how can it help identify the need for tuning?": "Observability plays a crucial role in performance tuning by providing insights into system behavior and helping identify the need for tuning. It allows performance engineers to understand how a system is performing, detect anomalies, and pinpoint areas for improvement. By collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces, observability tools enable engineers to gain visibility into the inner workings of a system. This visibility can reveal bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas of high resource utilization. Observability can help identify the need for tuning by highlighting performance issues, such as high CPU usage, memory pressure, or network congestion. For example, if observability tools show consistently high CPU utilization, it may indicate the need for CPU tuning, such as adjusting CPU affinity or scheduling parameters. Similarly, if memory usage is consistently high, tuning virtual memory parameters can help optimize memory management. By leveraging observability, performance engineers can proactively identify areas that require tuning and make data-driven decisions to improve system performance."

            "What were the performance improvements achieved by switching the clocksource to TSC on Ubuntu Trusty at Netflix?": "Switching the clocksource to TSC on Ubuntu Trusty at Netflix resulted in significant performance improvements. The speaker mentioned a best-case example where CPU usage was reduced by 30% and average application latency was reduced by 43%. This improvement highlights the impact of clocksource selection on system performance. The switch to TSC was made to address a performance regression observed when moving to Ubuntu Trusty. By changing the clocksource, the regression was mitigated, leading to improved CPU utilization and reduced latency. However, it's important to note that clock drift can be a concern when using TSC as the clocksource. In the past, TSC has been known to be unreliable, so careful monitoring and validation are necessary to ensure accurate timekeeping. Despite this caveat, the example demonstrates the potential performance gains that can be achieved through careful tuning and optimization of system parameters."

One of its main advantages is the ability to decompose metrics into distributions or per-event logs, which allows for a more detailed analysis of performance data. This can be particularly useful in identifying outliers or multiple modes that may be causing performance issues. Additionally, bpftrace enables the creation of new metrics, providing visibility into blind spots that may not be covered by traditional performance tools. A practical example of bpftrace usage is the tracing of read latency for a specific process ID (PID). By using the command `bpftrace -e 'kprobe:vfs_read /pid == 30153/ { @start[tid] = nsecs; } kretprobe:vfs_read /@start[tid]/ { @ns = hist(nsecs - @start[tid]); delete(@start[tid]); }'`, it is possible to trace the distribution of read latency for PID 30153 and visualize it as a power-of-two histogram. This allows for a detailed analysis of read latency, which can reveal performance issues that may not be visible with average latency values alone."

These probe types include tracepoint, usdt, kprobe, kretprobe, uprobe, uretprobe, software, hardware, and others. Tracepoint probes are kernel static instrumentation points, while usdt probes are user-level statically defined tracing points. Kprobe and kretprobe probes allow for the dynamic instrumentation of kernel functions, enabling detailed tracking of function execution times. Uprobe and uretprobe probes provide similar functionality but for user-level functions. Software probes are kernel software-based events, and hardware probes utilize hardware counters for instrumentation. These different probe types can be used to instrument specific events or functions of interest, allowing for detailed performance analysis. For example, the command `bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:sys_read /pid == 181/ { @bytes = hist(retval); }'` instruments the return of the `sys_read()` kernel function and produces a histogram of the returned read size for a specific PID. This can help identify if an application is performing inefficient read operations, such as frequent 1-byte reads, which could be optimized."

The author of the article had modified the JDK to preserve the frame pointer, which allowed traditional stack walkers and profilers to work. However, the resulting flame graphs did not clearly distinguish between Java and kernel frames. To address this, a performance engineer at Netflix suggested coloring the Java and kernel frames differently. The author quickly implemented this suggestion by adding eight lines of code to the flame graph generation process. This improvement made it easier to visually identify Java and kernel frames in the flame graphs."

One challenge was that the author's initial regex-based approach did not always correctly identify the code type. For example, some profiled Java symbols used `.` instead of `/` as a delimiter, leading to incorrect coloring. Additionally, there were cases where Java methods lacked any package delimiter, resulting in them being colored red instead of green. Similar issues were also observed with JIT'd code for Node.js.

By default, stackcollapse-perf.pl only extracts the symbol name from the perf script output. However, with the `--all` option, it also includes annotations that provide more details for identifying code types. These annotations are appended after the function name and can indicate whether the code is kernel code, JIT'd code, inlined code, or part of a waker stack. These annotations can be used by flamegraph.pl to apply different color hues to the code types, making it easier to visually distinguish between them in the flame graphs."

This can be useful for visually identifying the performance characteristics of specific code written by a team. Another use case could be highlighting code that is known to be performance-critical or prone to performance issues. By assigning a distinct color to such code, it becomes easier to spot potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization in the flame graphs. Customizing the code coloring can also be helpful when comparing flame graphs from different runs or different systems, as it allows for consistent visual cues across the graphs."

When the ARC detected low system memory, it would adjust its size accordingly, even if ZFS wasn't in use. The ARC would randomly select a zero-sized list using a CPU-expensive random number generator, leading to unnecessary CPU consumption. The author discovered this by analyzing the flame graph and tracing the code paths, which led them to the functions get_random_bytes() and extract_entropy()."

It provides a way to explore and study kernel behavior by quickly answering how a given function is being called. The tool works by using an eBPF map in the kernel for efficiency. It copies only unique stacks and their counts to the user-level for printing. The order of printed stack traces is from least to most frequent, with the most frequent stack trace printed last. The tool can be used to analyze the behavior of specific functions in the kernel and understand their usage patterns."

It provides a way to trace the execution flow of specific functions in the kernel and understand the sequence of function calls. The tool works by capturing the stack traces at the time of the event and printing them along with other relevant information such as the timestamp, process ID, and CPU. This can be useful for analyzing the performance of specific functions and identifying any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in their execution."

It is specific to x86_64 architecture, kernel-mode, and has a limited stack depth. It also requires explicit dereferencing of pointers using bpf_probe_read(). The author's workaround addresses these limitations by implementing a user-defined stack walker in eBPF. The workaround uses an unrolled loop to walk each frame and save the return instruction pointer for each frame into an array. While the workaround is specific to x86_64 and has a limited stack depth, it provides a way to perform stack walking in eBPF until proper stack walking support is available. The author mentions that once eBPF supports stack walking properly, much of the workaround code will become a single function call."

SystemTap has the capability to frequency count kernel and user-mode stack traces. However, these solutions have some differences compared to the stackcount tool. Ftrace and perf_events provide stack traces but may not have the same efficiency as the stackcount tool. SystemTap is an add-on and not part of the mainline kernel. The stackcount tool implements an important new capability for the core Linux kernel by providing frequency counting of stack traces. It allows for efficient exploration and study of kernel behavior by quickly answering how a given function is being called."

It can also be used when an extra build step is added for the Unix binary, allowing for testing with a test suite and profiler before Xen compilation. Additionally, developers may use Unix binary builds as a normal step for testing, and this type of profiling can help catch a variety of issues before running under Xen. Other tools like strace can also be used to debug the binary unikernel."

            "How can stack trace profiling be performed on a unikernel running as a Xen guest?": "To perform stack trace profiling on a unikernel running as a Xen guest, the unikernel needs to be compiled with frame pointers. This can be done by switching to a +fp ocaml compiler. Once the unikernel is compiled and running as a Xen guest, a symbol file is needed to translate the instruction pointer addresses in stack traces. This file can be created using objdump of the MirageOS compiled object. Finally, the xenctx command can be executed from dom0 to dump registers and the call stack of the domU. The -s option is used to specify the symbol file, and the output includes the call trace and translated frames."

Firstly, unikernels have no separate kernel-/user-mode stacks, so only one stack needs to be walked for everything. Secondly, unikernels have no separate processes, so only one symbol map is needed for translating addresses. This makes profiling in unikernels more straightforward and efficient. Additionally, unikernels provide a single address space without context switching and use hypercalls for various resources, allowing for more accurate profiling of performance issues that may only manifest when running under Xen."

The profiler can also be optimized to reduce latency introduced by the xc_domain_pause() function. Furthermore, the profiler can be rewritten entirely in C to improve performance. However, an alternative approach could be to develop a domU-from-domU profiler, which would allow profiling without requiring access to dom0.

These options include specifying the output interval (in seconds) and the number of outputs to display. For example, you can use the command `tcptop 5 10` to display the TCP send/receive throughput every 5 seconds for a total of 10 outputs. Additionally, the tool offers options like `-C` to prevent clearing the screen, `-S` to skip the system summary line, and `-p PID` to trace a specific PID only. These options allow you to tailor the output according to your specific requirements and preferences."
        },

            "What are the potential overhead considerations when using the tcptop tool and how can they be mitigated?": "When using the tcptop tool, it's important to consider the potential overhead it may introduce. The tool works by tracing send/receive events at the TCP level and summarizing session data in kernel context. The overhead is relative to the TCP event rate, which can vary depending on the workload. In general, the overhead of tcptop ranges from 0.5% to 2.0% of one CPU for TCP event rates of 4k to 15k events per second. However, in extreme cases with high event rates, such as 300k events per second, the overhead can be as high as 40% of one CPU. To mitigate the overhead, it's recommended to carefully monitor the event rates of your specific workload and assess the impact of tcptop. Additionally, you can consider optimizing the tool by using static tracepoints or polling tcp_info instead of instrumenting send/receive events, although these approaches may have their own limitations and trade-offs."

            "How does the use of tcp_info and RFC4898 counters in tcptop differ from the traditional approach of instrumenting send/receive events?": "The use of tcp_info and RFC4898 counters in tcptop offers an alternative approach to instrumenting send/receive events for performance analysis. Instead of directly tracing the events, tcptop polls tcp_info, which provides information about TCP session statistics, such as the number of bytes acknowledged and received. By leveraging these counters, tcptop can avoid the overhead associated with instrumenting send/receive events and potentially achieve lower overhead. However, there are challenges with this approach. Short-lived and partial sessions may be missed, as tcp_info doesn't stay around for TIME-WAIT and applications can establish short-lived TCP connections. Additionally, the overhead of polling tcp_info, caching the session state, and tracing TCP close paths may be higher than just tracing send/receive events in some workloads. The current implementation of tcptop involves tracing send/receive events, but the use of tcp_info and RFC4898 counters is being explored as a potential optimization."

When you see a high %CPU in tools like top(1), you might think that the processor is the bottleneck, but it's actually the memory subsystem that is causing the stalls. This is because CPUs have become much faster than main memory, and waiting on memory I/O is a common occurrence.

They provide detailed information about the performance of the CPU, including metrics like cycles, instructions, branches, and stalls. By using PMCs, you can measure the entire system and get insights into the utilization of the CPU. For example, you can measure the instructions per cycle (IPC), which shows on average how many instructions were completed for each CPU clock cycle. A higher IPC indicates better performance, while a lower IPC suggests that the CPUs are not running at their full potential. PMCs allow you to dig deeper into the performance of the CPUs and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement."

If your IPC is less than 1.0, it indicates that you are likely memory bound. In this case, you can focus on reducing memory I/O and improving CPU caching and memory locality. This can involve optimizing your code to minimize unnecessary memory accesses and improving data locality to reduce cache misses. On the hardware side, you can consider using processors with larger CPU caches and faster memory busses and interconnects. On the other hand, if your IPC is greater than 1.0, it suggests that you are instruction bound. Here, you can look for ways to reduce code execution, such as eliminating unnecessary work or optimizing cache operations. For hardware tuning, you can try increasing the clock rate or adding more cores/hyperthreads. By analyzing CPU utilization metrics and applying these performance tuning strategies, you can optimize the performance of your applications and systems."

One potential cause is queueing, which occurs when there is a backlog of I/O requests waiting to be processed by the disk. This can be caused by file systems that send a batch of writes or by the presence of other disk commands that slow down subsequent I/O. Performance analysis tools like iostat can provide insights into the queue size (aqu-sz) and the number of I/O requests (r/s and w/s), allowing administrators to determine if queueing is a contributing factor to high latency. Another potential cause is the disk itself. Rotational magnetic disks, for example, have additional latency from head seeks for random I/O and spin-ups from the idle state. Flash-memory-based disks may have their own performance characteristics. By analyzing the performance metrics provided by tools like iostat, administrators can identify if the disk is the source of high latency.

It supports various probe types, such as tracepoint, kprobe, uprobe, and more, which can be used to trace specific events and analyze their impact on disk performance. For example, bpftrace can be used to trace the distribution of read latency for a specific process ID (PID), revealing detailed information about latency outliers and potential performance bottlenecks. On the other hand, biosnoop is a BPF tool that provides per-event tracing of disk I/O. It captures detailed information about each disk event, including the timestamp, process ID, disk, operation type, sector, bytes, and latency.

IPC, or Instructions-per-cycle, is a metric that represents how many instructions can be completed with each CPU cycle. By measuring IPC, developers and system administrators can gain insights into the efficiency of their code and the utilization of CPU cycles. A higher IPC indicates that more instructions are being completed with each cycle, which suggests better utilization of CPU resources. On the other hand, a lower IPC may indicate inefficiencies in the code or potential bottlenecks. IPC analysis can help identify whether an application is memory-bound or instruction-bound, directing further tuning efforts. For example, if IPC is less than 1, it may suggest that the application is memory-bound and tuning memory usage, such as reducing object allocation or optimizing memory placement, could improve performance. Conversely, if IPC is greater than 1, it may suggest that the application is instruction-bound and reducing executed code could lead to performance improvements."

Tomcat served requests using threads for each connection, while RxNetty used event loop threads. By measuring CPU cycles per request using PMCs, it was observed that Tomcat's CPU cycles per request remained largely unchanged between low and high client counts, while RxNetty became more efficient and consumed less CPU per request as clients increased. This analysis provided insights into the performance characteristics of the two frameworks and helped identify the reasons behind the 46% higher request rate achieved by RxNetty. PMCs allowed for a detailed breakdown of the performance differences and explained every percentage point of the improvement. This real-world example demonstrates the value of PMCs in analyzing and optimizing the performance of applications and systems."

It can help identify performance bottlenecks, resource contention, and other issues that may impact software performance. Here's a real-world analysis case:\\n\\nAt Netflix, there was an issue with high CPU usage in a microservice that was impacting the overall system performance. To troubleshoot this issue, BPF tracing was used to trace the execution of the microservice and identify the hotspots causing the high CPU usage. The `profile` tool from the BPF observability toolkit was used to sample the stack traces of the running microservice.

These tools provide different ways to visualize and understand where disk space is being consumed. For example, du and ncdu provide a hierarchical view of disk usage, showing the size of directories and files. Treemaps use nested rectangles to represent the size of directories and files, with larger rectangles indicating larger sizes. The sunburst layout, on the other hand, uses polar coordinates to represent disk usage, with deeper slices indicating larger sizes. Each of these tools has its own strengths and can be used in different scenarios depending on the specific needs of the analysis."

The length of each rectangle represents the size of the directory or file, with longer rectangles indicating larger sizes. By comparing the lengths of the rectangles, you can get a sense of the relative sizes of different directories and files. The flame graph provides a high-level overview of disk space consumption, allowing you to quickly identify the largest contributors. For example, you can easily see that the drivers directory is over 50% of the total, with drivers/net accounting for about 15%. The flame graph is a concise and space-efficient way to convey important details about disk space consumption."
