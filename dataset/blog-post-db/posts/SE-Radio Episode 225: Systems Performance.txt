Just over a year ago I changed jobs, and temporarily had a long commute between Walnut Creek and Los Gatos (California), which spanned multiple highways packed with insane commuter traffic. This trip would take anything between one and two hours, depending on how many traffic jams there were (usually caused by accidents, and drivers rubber-necking the accidents). This gave me time each day to listen to podcasts, and I worked through many episodes of the excellent Software Engineering Radio . Recently I was invited on the show, and with Robert Blumen we recorded Episode 225: Brendan Gregg on Systems Performance . It goes for about an hour and we covered many topics, some inspired by my last book , including what systems performance is, methodologies, and challenges on the cloud. Explaining systems performance can be challenging, and I've put a lot of work into blog posts, books, conference talks, and tutorials. Each has their own pros and cons, and people have their own preferences for different forms of content. An advantage with the podcast is that I'm explaining topics in a conversational way, with emphasis you can hear, and with live responses to questions. Like it? Some other SE-Radio shows I recommend: Episode 89: Joe Armstrong on Erlang Episode 201: Martin Thompson on Mechanical Sympathy Episode 202: Andrew Gerrand on Go Episode 203: Leslie Lamport on Distributed Systems Episode 216: Adrian Cockcroft on the Modern Cloud-based Platform
