" line 9, kprobe:__nla_parse, I need to verify based on the context of what I ask, can you provide some refined constraints information on this line considering the context. 
    Here's the broader constraints of this function: Parse a stream of attributes into a tb buffer with pre condition tb should be !=null, maxtype should be >=0, head should be !=null, len should be >=0, policy should be !=null, validate should be >=0, extack should be !=null
    You should generate the refined constraints in following C format:
    ```c

      sassert([]);
    ```
    The requirement is to put the pre condition to the correstponding [] which assume will be inserted in line 11, sassert will be inserted in the end of the function kprobe:__nla_parse and should comply the c definitoin so that all the variable is defined in the context and should pass bpftrace compiler.

responses Based on the broader constraints you provided and the definition of the __nla_parse function, the refined constraints in C format would look like this:

In the `assume` line, we are ensuring that all the preconditions are met. We are checking that none of the arguments are NULL (where applicable) and that the integer arguments are greater than or equal to 0. 

In the `sassert` line, we are asserting that the maxtype (arg1) is equal to 2. This is based on your requirement to hook all the functions of __nla_parse and add up the arg1 as maxtype only if the maxtype is 2. 

Please replace the `assume` line at line 11 and the `sassert` line at the end of the function `kprobe:__nla_parse` in your bpftrace program.

" line 9, kprobe:__nla_parse, I need to verify based on the context of what I ask, can you provide some refined constraints information on this line considering the context. 
    Here's the broader constraints of this function: Parse a stream of attributes into a tb buffer with pre condition tb should be !=null, maxtype should be >=0, head should be !=null, len should be >=0, policy should be !=null, validate should be >=0, extack should be !=nullHowever, last time you generate wrong the function with error: nd is the first argument which should be arg0. 
    You should generate the refined constraints in following C format:

    The requirement is to put the pre condition to the correstponding [] which assume will be inserted in line 11, sassert will be inserted in the end of the function kprobe:__nla_parse and should comply the c definitoin so that all the variable is defined in the context and should pass bpftrace compiler. You only need to provide the pre condition in one line and post condition in one line if there are multiple of them you should use & to connect them.

    I'm working on a project involving writing bpftrace programs and I just got the job of tracing the __nla_parse() function to hook all the function of __nla_parse and add up the arg1 as maxtype only if the maxtype is 2., in my coded program "
#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace

BEGIN
{
	printf("Tracing bash commands... Hit Ctrl-C to end.\n");
	printf("%-9s %-6s %s\n", "TIME", "PID", "COMMAND");
}

kprobe:__nla_parse
{assume(arg0 != NULL & arg1 >= 0 & arg2 != NULL & arg3 >= 0 & arg4 != NULL & arg5 >= 0 & arg6 != NULL);
	@reqts[arg1] +=1;
if(!(arg1 == 2)) {error();}}

END
{
	clear(@reqts);
}
" line 9, kprobe:__nla_parse, I need to verify based on the context of what I ask, can you provide some refined constraints information on this line considering the context. 
    Here's the broader constraints of this function: Parse a stream of attributes into a tb buffer with pre condition tb should be !=null, maxtype should be >=0, head should be !=null, len should be >=0, policy should be !=null, validate should be >=0, extack should be !=nullHowever, last time you generate wrong the function with error: nd is the first argument which should be arg0. 
    You should generate the refined constraints in following C format:
    ```c
      assume([]);
      sassert([]);
    ```
    The requirement is to put the pre condition to the correstponding [] which assume will be inserted in line 11, sassert will be inserted in the end of the function kprobe:__nla_parse and should comply the c definitoin so that all the variable is defined in the context and should pass bpftrace compiler. You only need to provide the pre condition in one line and post condition in one line if there are multiple of them you should use & to connect them.
    And we know the definition of __nla_parse is int __nla_parse(struct nlattr **tb, int maxtype,const struct nlattr *head, int len,const struct nla_policy *policy, unsigned int validate,struct netlink_ext_ack *extack), we should put all the first argument tb's operation as to arg0, the second argument maxtype be arg1, the third argument head be arg2, the fourth argument len be arg3, the fifth argument policy be arg4, the sixth argument validate be arg5, and the seventh argument extack be arg6. You should replace the following parameter with corresponding one.
responses Based on your provided context and the broader constraints of the function, the refined constraints for the `kprobe:__nla_parse` line in your bpftrace program could be written in the following way:

```c
assume(arg0 != NULL & arg1 >= 0 & arg2 != NULL & arg3 >= 0 & arg4 != NULL & arg5 >= 0 & arg6 != NULL);
sassert(arg1 == 2);
```

In the `assume` line, we are ensuring that all the arguments are meeting the preconditions. Specifically, we are checking that `arg0` (tb), `arg2` (head), `arg4` (policy), and `arg6` (extack) are not NULL, and `arg1` (maxtype), `arg3` (len), and `arg5` (validate) are greater than or equal to 0.

In the `sassert` line, we are asserting that `arg1` (maxtype) is equal to 2, as per your requirement. This will be the post condition for the function `kprobe:__nla_parse`. 

Please replace the `arg0`, `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, `arg4`, `arg5`, and `arg6` with the corresponding parameters in your actual program.
assume(arg0 != NULL & arg1 >= 0 & arg2 != NULL & arg3 >= 0 & arg4 != NULL & arg5 >= 0 & arg6 != NULL);
sassert(arg1 == 2); 


tmp kprobe:__nla_parse
{assume(arg0 != NULL & arg1 >= 0 & arg2 != NULL & arg3 >= 0 & arg4 != NULL & arg5 >= 0 & arg6 != NULL);
	@reqts[arg1] +=1;
if(!(arg1 == 2)) {error();}
