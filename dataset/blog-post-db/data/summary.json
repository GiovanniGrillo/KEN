'Systems Performance' provides balanced coverage of models, theory, architecture, observability tools (traditional and tracing), experimental tools, and tuning. It is a comprehensive handbook that is suitable for anyone looking to learn about performance and computer internals. On the other hand, 'BPF Performance Tools' focuses specifically on BPF tracing tools. It provides in-depth coverage of these tools, along with brief summaries of architecture and traditional tools. While there may be some overlap between the two books, 'Systems Performance' has a wider audience and serves as a foundational resource, while 'BPF Performance Tools' caters to those who want to dive deeper into advanced tools for specific use cases.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"How does bpftrace improve upon the limitations of traditional Linux performance tools, and can you provide a practical example of its usage?\": \"Traditional Linux performance tools often rely on counter-based metrics, which can provide average values but lack the ability to reveal the distribution of these values. This limitation can obscure the identification of outliers or multiple modes, which could be the real cause of performance issues. bpftrace, an open-source tracer for Linux, improves upon this by allowing for the decomposition of metrics into distributions or per-event logs, and the creation of new metrics for visibility into blind spots. \n A practical example of bpftrace usage is the tracing of read latency for a specific process ID (PID). The command `bpftrace -e 'kprobe:vfs_read /pid == 30153/ { @start[tid] = nsecs; } kretprobe:vfs_read /@start[tid]/ { @ns = hist(nsecs - @start[tid]); delete(@start[tid]); }'` is used to trace the distribution of read latency for PID 30153, showing it as a power-of-two histogram. This allows for a detailed analysis of read latency, which can reveal performance issues not visible with average latency values alone.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are the different types of probes supported by bpftrace and how can they be used in performance analysis?\": \"bpftrace supports a variety of probe types, each offering different capabilities for performance analysis. These include tracepoint (kernel static instrumentation points), usdt (user-level statically defined tracing), kprobe and kretprobe (kernel dynamic function instrumentation and return), uprobe and uretprobe (user-level dynamic function instrumentation and return), software (kernel software-based events), hardware (hardware counter-based instrumentation), and others. For instance, kprobe and kretprobe can be used to instrument the entry and return of kernel functions, respectively. This allows for detailed tracking of function execution times, which can be crucial in identifying performance bottlenecks. An example of this is the command `bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:sys_read /pid == 181/ { @bytes = hist(retval); }'`, which instruments the return of the `sys_read()` kernel function and produces a histogram of the returned read size for PID 181. This can help identify if an application is performing inefficient read operations, such as frequent 1-byte reads, which could be optimized.\"\n    }\n]", "FreeBSD Flame Graphs": "[\n    {\n        \"What types of flame graphs were discussed in the talk on \"Flame Graphs for FreeBSD\"?\": \"In the talk on \"Flame Graphs for FreeBSD,\" several types of flame graphs were discussed.

Each type of flame graph provides a different perspective on performance analysis and can be used to navigate different types of profiling data. CPU flame graphs show how CPU usage is distributed across different functions or code paths, while memory flame graphs provide insights into memory usage patterns. Disk I/O flame graphs help identify bottlenecks in disk I/O operations, and off-CPU flame graphs reveal what CPUs are doing when they are not executing code. Chain graphs, on the other hand, visualize the flow of function calls and can be useful for understanding the overall structure of a program's execution.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"How can flame graphs be generated on FreeBSD using DTrace and pmcstat?\": \"Flame graphs can be generated on FreeBSD using DTrace and pmcstat.

By generating CPU flame graphs on the OCAs, the performance team at Netflix can gain insights into how CPU resources are being utilized and identify potential areas for optimization.\n\nIn addition to CPU flame graphs, the performance team also uses CPI flame graphs on the OCAs. CPI stands for cycles-per-instruction and indicates the efficiency of CPU execution. By visualizing CPI using flame graphs, the team can determine whether CPUs are busy executing code or stalled on memory I/O operations. This information is valuable for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing the overall system performance.\n\nTo automate the generation of CPU flame graphs on the OCAs, the team has developed scripts and tools that make it easy to generate and analyze flame graphs. This automation allows for not only easy creation of flame graphs but also their use in non-regression analysis, ensuring that performance improvements are maintained over time.\n\nOverall, flame graphs provide a powerful visualization tool for performance analysis on the Netflix Open Connect Appliances, enabling the performance team to gain deep insights into CPU usage and optimize the system for better streaming performance.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What were the key highlights of the talk on \"Flame Graphs for FreeBSD\" at the FreeBSD Developer and Vendor Summit?\": \"The talk on \"Flame Graphs for FreeBSD\" at the FreeBSD Developer and Vendor Summit covered several key highlights.

It is a part of the kernel's instrumentation infrastructure, specifically designed for performance analysis. When a kernel function is called, the '__fentry__' code is executed first, allowing for the collection of data about the function's execution. This data can include information such as the function's entry point, the caller's address, and other relevant details. By instrumenting every kernel function with '__fentry__', it becomes possible to trace the execution flow and analyze the performance of the kernel at a granular level.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"How does Ftrace instrument all kernel functions almost instantly and with low overhead?\": \"Ftrace is a powerful tracing framework in the Linux kernel that allows for the instrumentation of all kernel functions with low overhead. It achieves this by leveraging the '__fentry__' mechanism mentioned earlier. Ftrace takes advantage of the fact that '__fentry__' is already present at the start of every kernel function. Instead of adding additional instrumentation code, Ftrace simply hooks into the '__fentry__' code and collects the necessary data for tracing. This approach eliminates the need for modifying the kernel code extensively, resulting in minimal overhead. Additionally, Ftrace utilizes various optimizations, such as dynamic function graph (DFG) tracing, to further reduce the impact on system performance. These optimizations ensure that the tracing process is efficient and does not significantly slow down the Linux kernel.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Can you provide a real-world analysis case where Ftrace was used to analyze kernel internals?\": \"One real-world analysis case where Ftrace was used to analyze kernel internals is the investigation of a performance issue related to the 'schedule' function. The 'schedule' function is responsible for task scheduling in the Linux kernel. By using Ftrace, it was possible to trace the execution of the 'schedule' function and gather valuable insights into its behavior. The analysis involved examining the function's execution time, identifying any potential bottlenecks, and understanding the impact of different system configurations on its performance. Ftrace allowed for the collection of detailed data, such as the number of times the function was called, the duration of each execution, and the stack trace for each invocation. This information helped in pinpointing the root cause of the performance issue and optimizing the 'schedule' function for better overall system performance.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are some practical strategies for using Ftrace in performance analysis?\": \"When using Ftrace for performance analysis, there are several practical strategies that can be employed to maximize its effectiveness. One strategy is to selectively enable tracing for specific kernel functions or subsystems that are of interest. This helps in focusing the analysis on the relevant areas and reduces the amount of data collected, minimizing the impact on system performance. Another strategy is to utilize Ftrace's filtering capabilities to narrow down the traced events based on specific criteria, such as process ID or function name. This allows for targeted analysis and helps in isolating performance issues to specific components. Additionally, Ftrace provides various output formats, such as function histograms and stack traces, which can be used to visualize and analyze the collected data. These output formats aid in identifying patterns, outliers, and potential bottlenecks, facilitating the optimization of kernel functions and improving overall system performance.\"\n    }\n]", "Why Don't You Use ...": "[\n    {\n        \"What are some reasons why companies may choose not to use a particular technology?\": \"There are several reasons why companies may choose not to use a particular technology.

However, the benchmarks were usually wrong and produced random numbers for his product and his competitor's. This meant that the chances of winning a benchmark were essentially like flipping a coin. The salesperson believed that if the benchmarks were usually wrong, he had a 50/50 chance of winning. However, in reality, he didn't win 90%, 50%, or even 25% of the benchmarks. This example demonstrates how benchmarks can be unreliable and not reflect the true performance of a product.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Why can multiple benchmarks with the requirement of winning them all be problematic?\": \"Multiple benchmarks with the requirement of winning them all can be problematic because the more benchmarks there are, the worse the chances of winning them all become.

However, the probability of winning all three benchmarks was calculated to be 12.5% (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5). This means that the chances of winning all three benchmarks were quite low. When customers require a product to win multiple benchmarks, it essentially becomes a coin toss for each benchmark. This can be a problem for anyone promising high performance because a single poor result can cast doubt on their claims. Therefore, the more benchmarks there are with the requirement of winning them all, the higher the chances of flipping tails and not meeting the customer's expectations.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Why is benchmark gambling considered a sucker's game?\": \"Benchmark gambling is considered a sucker's game because it relies on the assumption that benchmarks are accurate and reliable indicators of product performance.

It is in the kernel source and is well maintained. Perf can do many things, but if I had to recommend you learn just one, it would be CPU profiling. Perf_events is commonly used for CPU profiling, which involves analyzing the performance of the CPU and identifying areas of improvement. This can be done by sampling the CPU at regular intervals and collecting data on the functions being executed. Perf_events can generate flame graphs, which are visual representations of the CPU profile that help identify hotspots and bottlenecks in the code. To use perf_events for CPU profiling, you can use the following command: `perf record -F 99 -a -g -- sleep 30`. This command records CPU samples at a frequency of 99 Hz for 30 seconds. After recording, you can generate a flame graph using the perf script command and the FlameGraph tool.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are some practical examples of performance analysis that can be done with Linux tracers?\": \"Linux tracers can be used for a wide range of performance analysis scenarios. Some practical examples include analyzing file system internals, TCP/IP processing, device drivers, and application internals. For example, with the ftrace tracer, you can trace events related to file system operations, such as file opens, reads, and writes. This can help identify performance bottlenecks in file system operations and optimize them for better performance. Another example is using perf_events to analyze TCP/IP processing. Perf_events can capture events related to network packets, such as packet drops, retransmissions, and latency. By analyzing these events, you can identify network performance issues and optimize the TCP/IP stack for better throughput and latency. Tracers can also be used to analyze device drivers and application internals. For instance, with SystemTap, you can trace events related to device driver operations, such as interrupts and I/O requests. This can help identify performance issues in device drivers and optimize them for better performance. Similarly, with perf_events, you can analyze the performance of specific functions in an application by profiling their execution time and identifying areas of improvement.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are some recommended tracers for performance or kernel engineers and what are their key features?\": \"For performance or kernel engineers, there are several recommended tracers that offer different features and capabilities. One option is SystemTap, which is considered the most powerful tracer. It can do everything from profiling to in-kernel programming. SystemTap compiles programs into kernel modules and loads them, allowing for detailed tracing and analysis. Another option is ftrace, which is built into the kernel and provides event tracing, event counting, and function-flow walking capabilities. Ftrace is highly hackable and has front ends like trace-cmd and the perf-tools collection. Perf_events is another recommended tracer for performance or kernel engineers. It is the main tracing tool for Linux users and offers features like profiling, user-level stack translation, and support for multiple concurrent users. Perf_events is relatively safe and can solve a wide range of performance issues. Finally, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is an in-kernel virtual machine that can run programs on events. It is being developed to enhance other tracers like ftrace and perf_events and offers impressive tools like latency heat maps. Each of these tracers has its own strengths and capabilities, so the choice depends on the specific requirements of the performance or kernel engineering task.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are the limitations and potential future developments of bpftrace?\": \"bpftrace is a new tracer for Linux that offers syscall event tracing with tcpdump-like syntax and lua post-processing. While it is an impressive tool, it currently has some limitations. One limitation is that it only supports syscalls at the moment, which means it cannot trace other types of events like tracepoints, kprobes, and uprobes. However, the developers are actively working on adding support for these features, as well as eBPF integration for in-kernel summaries. Another limitation is that it dumps all events to user-level for post-processing, which can introduce some overhead. However, this limitation is being addressed with the addition of container support. In terms of future developments, bpftrace has the potential to become a powerful and versatile tracer for Linux. With the addition of support for other types of probes and integration with eBPF, it can offer even more capabilities for performance analysis and troubleshooting. Additionally, the ongoing development of container support will make bpftrace more suitable for tracing applications running in containerized environments.

By reading individual event data from ftrace, iosnoop can process and display the block I/O events in real-time or with buffering for duration-based tracing.

This allows for the identification of latency outliers, such as I/O operations with unusually high latencies. By analyzing the sequence of I/O operations and their timestamps, it is possible to determine if there are any patterns or correlations that could explain the outliers. For example, in the article, it is shown that slow reads occurred after a batch of writes, indicating a potential interference between the two types of I/O. This information can be used to investigate and optimize the system's I/O behavior to reduce latency outliers.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are the caveats and limitations of using iosnoop for performance analysis?\": \"While iosnoop is a useful tool for performance analysis, it does have some caveats and limitations.

They may not always accurately reflect the true origin of the I/O, as shown in the article where awk and sshd were on-CPU but unlikely to be the origin of the I/O. Another limitation is that iosnoop relies on the ftrace framework, which may have its own limitations and implementation issues. For example, the article mentions issues with snapshots losing events and write errors with marker events. Additionally, iosnoop has some overhead, especially when capturing events without buffering. It is important to consider the CPU resources and potential event loss when using iosnoop for high IOPS systems or long-duration tracing.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Why did the author choose to develop iosnoop using the ftrace framework and what are the implications of this choice?\": \"The author chose to develop iosnoop using the ftrace framework because it provided a lightweight and accessible way to trace block I/O on Linux systems. By utilizing the ftrace framework, iosnoop can leverage the existing tracepoints and infrastructure in the Linux kernel, without the need for additional software additions like SystemTap or perf_events. This choice allowed iosnoop to be a simple shell script that can run on a wide range of Linux systems running the 3.2 kernel or later. However, the choice of ftrace also comes with some implications. While ftrace is a powerful framework, it may not provide the same level of robustness, buffering, and concurrent user support as more advanced tracers like perf_events or SystemTap.

The selfless brilliant jerk, represented by the fictional character Alice, is a brilliant engineer who cares about the company but lacks empathy for others. She is direct and honest, often coming across as mean-spirited when expressing her unpopular opinions. Alice believes that being mean shouldn't hurt the company and sees little business value in empathy. On the other hand, the selfish brilliant jerk, represented by the fictional character Bob, is a brilliant engineer who is selfish, lacks empathy, and has delusions of grandeur. He believes that any behavior that benefits himself is justified, even if it means abusing and exploiting others. Bob is charming and charismatic, using his personality to manipulate and deceive others. While both types of brilliant jerks exhibit negative behavior, the selfless jerk may still have some positive impact on the company, while the selfish jerk causes significant damage.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"What are some of the behaviors exhibited by the selfish brilliant jerk, Bob, and how do they impact the company?\": \"Bob, the selfish brilliant jerk, exhibits a range of negative behaviors that have a significant impact on the company. He interrupts others and ignores their opinions, believing that he is the most important person in the room. Bob only works on projects that benefit himself, leaving others to finish his abandoned work. He bullies, humiliates, and oppresses individuals, using sarcasm and insults to shame and mock them. Bob engages in displays of dominance in front of groups, showing his superiority and disregarding the feelings of others. He tries to assert authority over all areas of the company, denigrating those he cannot control. Bob is negative, trash-talking others and attacking technologies that don't align with his own beliefs. He manipulates and misleads, using deception and lies to further his own agenda. Bob also uses physical intimidation, invading personal space and making violent gestures. These behaviors have a detrimental impact on the company, including silencing technical opinions, demoralizing staff, causing stress-related illness, increasing absenteeism and turnover, discouraging customers and investors, reducing efficiency, and inspiring others to imitate his behavior.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"How can companies effectively deal with brilliant jerks like Bob, and what steps can be taken to address their behavior?\": \"Dealing with brilliant jerks like Bob requires a multi-faceted approach. One important step is for companies to adopt a \"no brilliant jerks\" policy, explicitly stating that such behavior will not be tolerated. This policy should come from the CEO or top leadership to have the most impact. Management should be educated about the damage caused by brilliant jerks and be convinced that their behavior should not be tolerated, regardless of their brilliance. Regular one-on-one meetings and skip-level meetings can help inform management about the damage caused by jerks. When dealing with Bob, it is important to provide feedback about his behavior, making it clear that it hurts people and the company. However, changing Bob's behavior may be challenging, as he may not care about the impact of his actions. Firing a brilliant jerk is a complicated process that requires careful consideration and following established procedures. It may also be necessary to share speaking opportunities and rewarding projects among staff to reduce Bob's influence. Conference organizers can adopt a \"no brilliant jerks\" policy, and attendees can avoid conferences that host known jerks. Overall, addressing the behavior of brilliant jerks requires a combination of policies, education, feedback, and a commitment to creating a positive and respectful work environment.\"\n    }\n]"}
