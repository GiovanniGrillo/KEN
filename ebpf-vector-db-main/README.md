## ebpf-vector-db

### Introduction

`ebpf-vector-db` is a project leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT to process these documents and generate a set of key questions and corresponding answers based on the content. This database is designed to store information extracted from various documents related to eBPF.

### How it Works

The ebpf-vector-db project follows a simple workflow to build the knowledge vector database:

1. Document Collection: Gather relevant eBPF-related documents from trusted sources.

2. Document Processing: Use ChatGPT to generate three to four key questions for each document based on its content.

3. Answer Generation: ChatGPT provides answers to the generated questions by leveraging its knowledge.

4. Q&A Organization: Compile the question-answer pairs into a JSON format, with each document forming a block in the knowledge vector database.

5. Database Construction: Store the JSON-formatted Q&A pairs as knowledge vectors to create the knowledge vector database.

6. Database Utilization: Users can query the database using keywords to retrieve relevant Q&A pairs and gain insights into eBPF topics.

The knowledge vector database serves as a valuable resource for learning and exploring eBPF technology efficiently.
