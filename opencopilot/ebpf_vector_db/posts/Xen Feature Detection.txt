In my previous post What Color Is Your Xen , I summarized the different Xen modes, and presented them in a slightly different manner to emphasize the evolution of versions. The current spectrum of modes has: HVM (full hardware virtual machine), PV (full paravirtualization), HVM with PV drivers, PVHVM, and PVH. So what mode is your Xen guest running with now? There are various tools you can use check whether HVM is enabled and which PV features are active, which I've summarized for Linux in this post. These identify your guest type on the spectrum image above. Note that I'm not a Xen developer, so I'm not the source for Truth on this topic, although I hope I can help. The following commands are intended for EC2 users, where you can't just read the AWS Xen config. For more info on verifying features, see Xen Linux PV on HVM drivers . dmesg I wish there was one tool that explained what mode/features a Xen guest was using. There are virtualization detection tools, like virt-what , imvirt , and xen-detect , but none of these provide much detail other than "Xen" and "HVM". The closest, right now, is running dmesg, and looking for lines containing "Xen". Here is an EC2 PV instance, with a Linux 3.2.0-54-virtual kernel: $ dmesg | grep -i xen [    0.000000]  Xen: 0000000000000000 - 00000000000a0000 (usable)

[    1.484535] XENBUS: Device with no driver: device/console/0 This time "Xen HVM" is detected, and we have "unplug emulated" lines for NICs and disks – this is Xen switching from the slower HVM network and disk drivers, to PV ones, after finding they are available. The "HVM callback vector" line shows that PV interrupts are enabled (from PVHVM), which is a big difference. On full HVM mode, emulated PCI interrupts are used for device I/O delivery, along with emulating the PCI bus, local APIC, and IO APIC. If you doing a high rate of disk I/O or network packets – which is easy to do on today's networks – these emulation overheads add up. With vector callbacks instead of interrupts, the Xen hypervisor can call the destination guest driver directly, avoiding these overheads. Another advantage of the vector callback interface is that Xen can perform CPU load balancing depending on the type of interrupt, instead of interrupts always directed to one CPU. Stefano Stabellini, the lead developer for this work, summarized these in his Linux PV on HVM talk ( slides ), which I recommend. Note that newer kernels can add more lines; eg: [    0.000000] xen: PV spinlocks enabled This message was added recently (PV spinlocks have been available for a long time). /sys/hypervisor There are some useful details in this location, especially the feature bits: # cat /sys/hypervisor/properties/features 00000705 Except I really need a tool to turn this into something human readable. They are defined in the Linux source, under include/xen/interface/features.h. Ok, I just wrote a simple one, called xen-features.pl (GitHub): $ ./xen-features.pl Xen features: 00000705
enabled: writable_page_tables
enabled: auto_translated_physmap
enabled: hvm_callback_vector
enabled: hvm_safe_pvclock
enabled: hvm_pirqs So far a little better than the raw hex number. This could easily be enhanced to say more. I did write this in Perl, despite the hackernews community repeatedly saying that Perl is dead. It fits better with Xen this way, as the Xen hypervisor is also written in Perl, as are the Linux PV drivers – which actually stand for Perl-Virt, and not Para-Virt. (ok, I made that up. Here's the python version.) Other Tools Here are various other tools that might be helpful. Note that I'm not a Xen developer, and I'm not certain of these. The best reference (other than a Xen developer) is the Xen code, and the linux/arch/x86/xen code, which I've been reading.

[    0.000000] xen:events: Xen HVM callback vector for event delivery is enabled This shows that HVM is active, which will use hardware virtualization for privileged instructions and page tables should be fastest. This is expected to be faster than paravirt. The capabilities of the hypervisor can also be checked: # grep hvm /sys/hypervisor/properties/capabilities xen-3.0-x86_64 xen-3.0-x86_32p hvm -3.0-x86_32 hvm -3.0-x86_32p hvm -3.0-x86_64 This shows that the physical host and Xen hypervisor you are on support HVM, which is useful to know. It does not show that HVM is active for your current guest (in fact, this example came from a PV guest). Red Herrings Many sites recommend checking for the following flags, to see if HVM is supported: # egrep 'vmx|smv' /proc/cpuinfo # Well, it showed nothing for me, despite Xen boot messages claiming this is HVM. These flags can only be inspected from the host, not the guest, where they may be masked if nested virtualization is not supported or disabled (eg, for security reasons ). Also, configured doesn't mean active: # grep XEN.*PV /boot/config-3.15.0-rc2 CONFIG_XEN_PVHVM=y
CONFIG_XEN_PVH=y
CONFIG_XEN_HAVE_PVMMU=y These mean the guest supports these modes, if the hypervisor does. I've turned on PVH here and booted the kernel, but this Xen version (4.2) doesn't have PVH. More Info In this post showed tools you can use from within a guest to see which HVM or PV features are enabled. For more information on this topic, see Xen Linux PV on HVM drivers from the Xen wiki, and also the tools in the Xen source (xen/tools).
