For USENIX LISA2021 I gave a 40 minute deep dive talk on BPF internals for Linux, focusing on observability tracing tools. Since there are already BPF internals references online (listed in this post) I used the opportunity to create some new content, showing how bpftrace instrumentation works from user space down to machine code. I break it down to all the small components involved, where you'll find it's actually quite easy. The video is on youtube : The slides are here or as a PDF : first prev next last / permalink/zoom loadslides("LISA2021_BPF_Internals", 122) Thanks to USENIX LISA for not only hosting this talk, but also for suggesting it. Internals talks can feel like they don't have strong take-aways, so I usually share that content in websites and books instead where people can browse as needed. But other USENIX events have had success with these "Core Principles" topics, so I gave it a try this time. How do you like it? As this is content that otherwise wouldn't exist without USENIX's help, my thanks to everyone who supports USENIX.

For high-frequency updates you can also subscribe to the bpf-next mailing list, or for low-frequency summaries search for "BPF" in the KernelNewbies summaries . There is also a substantially different implementation of BPF internals that I didn't cover at all in this talk: eBPF on Windows by Microsoft, only recently made public. In other BPF news, I just found out that my Addison-Wesley BPF Performance Tools book is in a snap 5-day sale until June 19 .
