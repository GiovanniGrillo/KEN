It's an exciting time for developments in computer performance, not just for the BPF technology (which I often write about ) but also for processors with 3D stacking and cloud vendor CPUs (e.g., AWS Graviton2); for memory with the arrival of DDR5 and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) on-processor; for storage including new uses for 3D Xpoint as a 3D NAND accelerator; for networking with the rise of QUIC and eXpress Data Path (XDP); and so on. I summarized these topics and more as a plenary conference talk, including my own predictions (as a senior performance engineer) for the future of computing performance, with a focus on back-end servers. The video is on youtube : The slides are here or as a PDF : first prev next last / permalink/zoom loadslides("LISA2021_ComputingPerformance", 113) I work on many areas of performance, but recently I've had a lot of demand to talk about BPF. This was a chance to talk about other things I've been working on, such as the present and future of hardware performance. I also wrote about these topics in detail for my recent Systems Performance 2nd Edition book. Note that my predictions in this talk may be wrong, but they should be thought-provoking. I hope you enjoy it!

I followed that practice when writing some earlier books, and it has since struck me as unfair that some references had author names and some didn't. Nowadays I always include full names when known. In case you are interested, at the same conference I also gave a talk on BPF Internals .
